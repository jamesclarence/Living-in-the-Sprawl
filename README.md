Living in the Sprawl
====================

Code and data for my blog Living in the Sprawl: http://jamesclarence.wordpress.com/.

**Poldi Instagram** - Blog post cataloguing German National Team forward Lukas Podolskiâ€™s
Instagram feed during the World Cup. He loves the thumbs up pose. Published on July 12, 2014: http://jamesclarence.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/world-cup-2014-thumbs-up-from-lukas-podolski-instagram-star/

**Justified Episodes** - Blog post using user ratings on IMDb to analyze season 1-5 of the FX drama Justified. I used R to scrape IMDb sites to get the user ratings and Wikipedia to find Justified's TV ratings.

**Medicaid Enrollment June 2014** - Post using Medicaid enrollment numbers released August 8, 2014, by the federal government to show the Medicaid enrollment change from May to June 2014, pre-open enrollment for Medicaid compared to June 2014, and pre-open enrollment for Medicaid compared to June 2014 by type of health insurance exchange. Each comparison is split between states that are expanding Medicaid and those that are not.

**Wooster Football** - Tracks the winning percentage and point differential of the College of Wooster football team from 1999-2013. Based on their seven-win season with a negative point differential, the 2013 season might have been lucky. Statistics are from CoW's football site and Soren Sorenson.

**Oberlin Football** - Oberlin College is not a football school. I look at the point differential for each Oberlin football game from 2000-2013, highlighting the games against the College of Wooster. I also analyze the difference in attendance for Oberlin's home and away games. Data from North Coast Athletic Conference site.

**Braves Salary Per Win, 1988-2014** - In the wake of Atlanta Braves' general manager Frank Wren's firing, I create a new metric that "normalizes" a baseball team's salary per win. I compare the value of the salary per win of the Braves since 1988 as compared to an 81-win (.500 winning percentage) team with the same salary. Data from USA Today and Baseball Reference.

**Nashville Building** - My first attempt making a map in R. I took building permit data for new residences in Metro Nashville from Metro Nashville open data web site, and mapped where those permits are located.

**Lawmakers** - Two entries using data from the new political science book, *Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers* by Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman. They created a metric to measure legislative effectiveness of House members. The two posts:

1. "Legislative Effectiveness, Part I: Pelosi vs. Boehner" - A look at effectiveness of majority and minority party members, plus comparing the effectiveness of Nancy Pelosi versus John Boehner. Published on November 16, 2014: https://jamesclarence.wordpress.com/2014/11/16/legislative-effectiveness-part-i-pelosi-vs-boehner/

2. "Legislative Effectiveness, Part II: The South" - The effectiveness of congressmembers from the US South. I used US Census Bureau's s designation of regions and divisions, but split one Southern division, South Atlantic, into two divisions.
