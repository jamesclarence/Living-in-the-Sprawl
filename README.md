Living in the Sprawl
====================

Code and data for my blog Living in the Sprawl: http://jamesclarence.wordpress.com/.

**Poldi Instagram** - Blog post cataloguing German National Team forward Lukas Podolskiâ€™s
Instagram feed during the World Cup. He loves the thumbs up pose. Published on July 12, 2014: http://jamesclarence.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/world-cup-2014-thumbs-up-from-lukas-podolski-instagram-star/

**Justified Episodes** - Blog post using user ratings on IMDb to analyze season 1-5 of the FX drama Justified. I used R to scrape IMDb sites to get the user ratings and Wikipedia to find Justified's TV ratings.

**Medicaid Enrollment June 2014** - Post using Medicaid enrollment numbers released August 8, 2014, by the federal government to show the Medicaid enrollment change from May to June 2014, pre-open enrollment for Medicaid compared to June 2014, and pre-open enrollment for Medicaid compared to June 2014 by type of health insurance exchange. Each comparison is split between states that are expanding Medicaid and those that are not.

**Wooster Football** - Tracks the winning percentage and point differential of the College of Wooster football team from 1999-2013. Based on their seven-win season with a negative point differential, the 2013 season might have been lucky. Statistics are from CoW's football site and Soren Sorenson.

**Oberlin Football** - Oberlin College is not a football school. I look at the point differential for each Oberlin football game from 2000-2013, highlighting the games against the College of Wooster. I also analyze the difference in attendance for Oberlin's home and away games. Data from North Coast Athletic Conference site.
